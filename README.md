### MoneyBall-For-Soccer

I came up with this idea from a film called “Moneyball”. In the film, the main character ‘Beane’ is facing a huge problem. He needs to build a team of undervalued talent by taking a sophisticated sabermetric approach towards scouting and analyzing players.
 Suppose you are Beane, but this time you are lucky enough to have the whole world’s football players data in your hand. What will you do change the game ??
